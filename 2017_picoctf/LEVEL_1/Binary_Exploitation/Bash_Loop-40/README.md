## Bash Loop - 40

### Description

We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/de905332a1594a49f78931c233b0eb2b and try it out!

### Hint

  - Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well

### Write up

    $ ./bashloop
    What number am I thinking of? It is between 0 and 4096

    $ ./bashloop 1
    Nope. Pick another number between 0 and 4096

So we need to guess the number between 0 to 4096.

Let's automate this by using loop.

    $ for i in {0..4096}; do ./bashloop $i; done;
    Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: c5d35a85c2c2ea7c69a84f6756f57bb1

(you need to scroll up a bit)
