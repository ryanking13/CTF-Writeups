## Internet Kitties - 10

### Description

I was told there was something at IP shell2017.picoctf.com with port 12275. How do I get there? Do I need a ship for the port?

### Hint

  - Look at using the netcat (nc) command!

  - To figure out how to use it, you can run "man nc" or "nc -h" on the shell, or search for it on the interwebz

### Write up

    nc localhost 12275
