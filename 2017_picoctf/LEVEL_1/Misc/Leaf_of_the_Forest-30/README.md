## Leaf of the Forest - 30

### Description

We found an even bigger directory tree hiding a flag starting at /problems/3a36b3b0858a593882b7d6a0dc5bd2f9. It would be impossible to find the file named flag manually...

### Hint

  - Is there a search function in Linux? Like if I wanted to 'find' something...

### Write up

    $ find -name flag
    ...omitted...
