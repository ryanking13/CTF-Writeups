## Biscuit - 75

### Description

Your friend has a personal website. Fortunately for you, he is a bit of a noob when it comes to hosting a website. Can you find out what he is hiding? [Website](http://shell2017.picoctf.com:46787/).

### Hint

  - Viewing the source of the website is usually a good start.

### Write up

The page shows `Access Denied` message.

In page source, we can find

```html
<!-- Storing stuff in the same directory as your web server doesn't seem like a good idea -->
<!-- Thankfully, we use a hidden one that is super PRIVATE, to protect our cookies.sqlite file -->
<style>
body{
	background-image: url("private/image.png");
}
</style>
```

There is `cookies.sqlite` file somewhere in server.

And we can get that file from __private/cookies.sqlite__

    $ sqlite3 cookies.sqlite
    sqlite> .tables
    moz_cookies
    sqlite> select * from moz_cookies;
    1|localhost|0|0|ID|F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd|localhost|/|1489365457|1489279130600290|1489279057101857|0|0
    sqlite>

So, the localhost uses `F3MAqpWxIvESiUNLHsflVd` as a ID cookie.

When we change our ID cookie to it, no more Access Denied, and gets the flag.
