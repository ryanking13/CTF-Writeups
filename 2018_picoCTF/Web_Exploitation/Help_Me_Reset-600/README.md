trying to reset with this name asks question such as

```
What is you favorite color?
```

Interesting thing is, even if I refresh, the question still remains.

It means that it stores username inside cookie.

So, let's decode cookie with script below.

```
from itsdangerous import base64_decode, base64_encode
import zlib
import json
def decode(cookie):
    """Decode a Flask cookie."""
    try:
        compressed = False
        payload = cookie

        if payload.startswith('.'):
            compressed = True
            payload = payload[1:]

        data = payload.split(".")[0]

        data = base64_decode(data)
        if compressed:
            data = zlib.decompress(data)

        return data.decode("utf-8")
    except Exception as e:
        return "[Decoding error: are you sure this was a Flask session cookie? {}]".format(e)



cookie = '.eJxNjcEOgjAQRH_FzLkHNEqUX1FC1rICAl2yLfZA-Hfbi_H0MpPdNxvsqsouoIIlnWlkGCzi_fCcGNX9r32JtAk9qyRYmURRG-jQ9aGxsmZJYbB61qalQKg2HEJ29DSnj9u5LIrjtTxdYNKdcrb5haJL_Mg0-kgd56CDzYNvcewfDvVuEFVc91vZv4C0OxU.DpOdqw.KeTT-wuveMbwTmrUMLdtlVDcnSU'
decoded = decode(cookie)
print(decoded)

```

which shows

```
{"current":"carmake","possible":["carmake","food","hero","color"],"right_count":0,"user_data":{" t":["ham","9460018625",0,"red","spawn","volkswagen","rice","jones\n"]},"wrong_count":0}
```

answer is here!
