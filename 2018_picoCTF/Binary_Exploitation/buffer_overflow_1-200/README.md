```
void win() {
  char buf[FLAGSIZE];
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("Flag File is Missing. Problem is Misconfigured, please contact an Admin if you are running this on the shell server.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(buf,FLAGSIZE,f);
  printf(buf);
}

void vuln(){
  char buf[BUFSIZE];
  gets(buf);

  printf("Okay, time to return... Fingers Crossed... Jumping to 0x%x\n", get_return_address());
}
```

```
$ nm vuln | grep win
080485cb T win
```
